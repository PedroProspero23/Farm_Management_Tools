# Farm_Management_Tools

This repository is dedicated to the development of digital tools that support the operational management of agricultural properties. With a practical focus on organizing, automating, and simplifying farm routines, the goal here is to create solutions that improve decision-making in the field and at the office. These tools are designed to help producers, managers, and technical staff handle complex processes such as scheduling operations, assigning machinery and labor, tracking input usage, and organizing field activities — all in a structured and accessible way.

Coming from a background in Business Administration at the European International University in Paris and pursuing an MBA in Project Management at USP ESALQ (e-distance learning), I’m committed to creating tools that balance technical accuracy with usability. This repository explores how simple technologies — mainly Python and Streamlit, supported by Excel and Power BI — can be used to digitize and enhance traditional farm management workflows. 

Projects included here may vary from digital logbooks and task planning apps to simulation tools that estimate machinery allocation or labor needs across multiple plots and timeframes. Each tool is built with real use cases in mind, often inspired by challenges observed on farms where logistics, cost control, and timing are critical to operational efficiency.

As I expand this repository, my aim is to continue testing new ways to bring innovation to farm management through technology, always keeping the interface intuitive and the backend solid. These tools are a step toward building smarter, more organized, and data-driven agricultural systems.
