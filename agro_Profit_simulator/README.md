# 🌾 Agricultural Profit Simulator with Monte Carlo

This interactive web app was built with Python and Streamlit to simulate farm profit scenarios using Monte Carlo simulations.

It allows farmers and agribusiness professionals to better understand the potential variability of profits by adjusting key inputs like costs, yields, and market prices.

## ✅ Features

- Customize farm size and fixed costs
- Adjust cost, yield, and selling price inputs for soy and corn
- Set **percentage variation** in costs, production, and prices to reflect real market uncertainty and explore profit margins
- Run thousands of Monte Carlo simulations to estimate potential outcomes
- Visualize results through intuitive charts
- Learn how each calculation works via an explanation tab
